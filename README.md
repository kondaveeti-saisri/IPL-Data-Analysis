IPL Data Analysis 📊🏏
Project Overview
This project analyzes Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains detailed match information, including teams, players, toss results, match winners, and statistical details.

Objective
The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from IPL match data, such as:
✔️ Best-performing teams and players
✔️ Impact of winning the toss on match outcomes
✔️ Correlation between match statistics
✔️ Visualization of key trends using bar charts & heatmaps

Dataset
📂 Source: Kaggle - IPL Dataset
🔢 Total Matches: 1095
📊 Columns: 20 (Teams, Winner, Toss Decision, Player of the Match, etc.)
Technologies Used
🔹 Python 🐍
🔹 Pandas 🏗️ (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊 (Data Visualization)
🔹 Jupyter Notebook 📓

Analysis & Insights
1️⃣ Top Teams & Players
Identified the teams with the most wins
Found top players based on "Player of the Match" awards
2️⃣ Does Winning the Toss Matter?
Analyzed whether winning the toss gives a team a higher chance of winning
Visualized the impact using bar charts
3️⃣ Correlation Analysis
Used a heatmap to find relationships between result margin, target runs, and overs
Discovered which factors contribute to big wins
Visualizations
📊 Bar Charts – Team & player performance, toss impact
🔥 Heatmaps – Correlation between match statistics

How to Run the Project?
1️⃣ Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
2️⃣ Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step.

Future Improvements 🚀
🔹 Add Power BI dashboards for interactive analysis
🔹 Include team rivalry and home vs. away match performance
🔹 Build a machine learning model to predict match winners
